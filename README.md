# Dlithe-Internship_Report


Summary of My Internship at Dlithe:

          The training has divided into 4 weeks total out of that First 2 weeks i have learned how to setup and use Google Collab and also how to use github to share our source codes in it.after getting handy with all basic requirments the training started with basics of python such as variables,data types,conditional statements,looping statements,Docstring,Error Handling and Data structers.
          
          After brushing up all the necessary knowledge on python our Guide/Mentor sohan started the Data Science part of the Internship Training.in this he taught us some of the main libraries used in Data science such as Numpy,Pandas,Sns,Matplotlib which are helpful in data  processing and visualization.
          
Below are some of the assignments i have done during the internship period..

Fish_weight_Prediction:-
                    the Fish data set which i have used in this assignment have been downloaded from kaggle.by using pandas,numpy,seaborn,matplotlib libraries i have done data preprocessing,visualizations for better understanding and atlast found r2 score for better understanding of how our independent variables impact target variables.
                    
Gpu_Runtime:-
          in this dataset i have implemented logistic regression and also i have removed null values by using mean/median, i have used Inter Quartile Range to detect outliers ,matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, used minmaxscaler and standardscaler in sklearn preprocessing
          
CarPrice_Prediction:-
                  this assignment i have downloaded from kaggele for predicting the price of car.i have removed some unnecessary columns from dataset for better predictions, null values and histograms for visualization,heatmap for correlation. in this i have implemented RandomForestRegressor algorithm and got R2 score 96 accuracy.
